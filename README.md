# VTK_Camera_Projection
Toy example showing 3D to 2D perspective projection using VTK

This is a short script that I wrote in order to project a 3D point onto the image using VTK (and OpenCV, for visualizing the result)

VTK's documentation  is not very good concerning the transformations involved, and I spent a lot of time figuring it out, so I made a small repository to share the code
